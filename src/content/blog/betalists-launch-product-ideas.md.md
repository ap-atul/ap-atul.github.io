## betalists.xyz

Just launched a product hunt alternative. Full of desperation to build something similar and seeing other people doing the same, can't help but finally build and deploy it. It took me 2 weeks of development to build this, though I yoinked the entire code base of open-launch, did some branding changes, colors and payment gateway switch from stripe to polar. It works!

It's not the best designed system, but it works, and hopefull make some sales for me. The desperation was not to build a product for other builders, but was to make some money.

It is easy money only if you other builders see the value, but damn its hard to actually make it work.

## how's it doing?

I got total 5 sign ups, 7 projects. It is day 2, hopefully more people with respond to my promotional tweets and drop their free launches and hopefully someone purchase a premium spot. I have been directly sharing links in replies and posts on X to promote this.

## whats' next

Thinking of building a discord community, adding link to discord in the footer and getting more people/builders in one place. So in the future I could leverage this following is some way or the other. It's long shot but doesn't cost me anything to try it out.

## socials

I managed to recreate another [X](https://x.com/betalistsxyz) account after my last account was suspended. Hope this one stays active for long, I am not promoting the platform much on new account just to be safe.

I have created a discord server for all the builders. Come [join](https://discord.gg/2zagApppRX)

## concluding

I will keep updating the site, hope to get more users!
